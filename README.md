# heart-disease-prediction
Machine learning models and analysis for predicting heart disease using clinical data.
# Heart Disease Analysis

This project explores a dataset related to heart disease. The goal is to predict the presence of heart disease using machine learning models.

# Project Structure
- `notebooks/` - Contains Jupyter notebooks for analysis and model building.
- `scripts/` - Contains Python scripts for data preprocessing and modeling.
- `data/` - Contains the dataset (heart.csv).

# Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

# Instructions
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tm-ui/heart-disease-analysis.git

   # Dataset Source

This project uses the [Heart Disease UCI Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cherngs/heart-disease-cleveland-uci) from Kaggle. The dataset was contributed by Cherngs and is sourced from the Cleveland database in the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
